## Instructions

1. Set up order list. Order list will store a list of dictionaries for menu item name, item price, and quantity ordered

    -  Launch the store and present a greeting to the customer
    -  Customers may want to order multiple items, so let's create a continuous loop
    - Ask the customer from which menu category they want to order
    - Create a variable for the menu item number
    - Create a dictionary to store the menu for later retrieval
    - Print the options to choose from menu headings (all the first level dictionary items in menu).
        - Store the menu category associated with its menu item number
        - Add 1 to the menu item number
    - Get the customer's input
    - Check if the customer's input is a number
        - Check if the customer's input is a valid option
            - Save the menu category name to a variable
            - Print out the menu category name they selected
            - Print out the menu options from the menu_category_name
            - Check if the menu item is a dictionary to handle differently

2. Ask customer to input menu item number

3. Check if the customer typed a number
    -  Convert the menu selection to an integer

4. Check if the menu selection is in the menu items
    - Store the item name as a variable
    - Ask the customer for the quantity of the menu item
    - Check if the quantity is a number, default to 1 if not
    - Add the item name, price, and quantity to the order list
        - Tell the customer that their input isn't valid
        - Tell the customer they didn't select a menu option
        - Tell the customer that their input isn't valid
        - Tell the customer they didn't select a number
        - Ask the customer if they would like to order anything else
        
5. Check the customer's input
    - Keep ordering
    - Exit the keep ordering question loop
    - Complete the order
    - Since the customer decided to stop ordering, thank them for their order
    - Exit the keep ordering question loop
    - Tell the customer to try again
    - Print out the customer's order
    - Uncomment the following line to check the structure of the order

6. Loop through the items in the customer's order for item in order_list

7. Store the dictionary items as variables

8. Calculate the number of spaces for formatted printing

9. Create space strings
   
10. Print the item name, price, and quantity

11. Calculate the cost of the order using list comprehension
    - Multiply the price by quantity for each item in the order list, then sum # and print the prices.
